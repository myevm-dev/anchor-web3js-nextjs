[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsolana-developers%2Fanchor-web3js-nextjs&root-directory=frontend&demo-title=Anchor%20Web3.js%20Next.js%20Demo&demo-description=An%20example%20deployment%20of%20the%20Anchor%20Web3.js%20Next.js%20project.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor-web3js-nextjs.vercel.app%2F&project-name=anchor-web3js-nextjs&repository-name=anchor-web3js-nextjs)

A beginner-friendly template for building applications (dApps) on Solana using Anchor and Next.js. This template implements a counter program that demonstrates essential Solana development concepts including PDAs (Program Derived Addresses), CPIs (Cross-Program Invocations), and state management.

To try the demo, make sure to use a test wallet connected to devnet.

This template is for educational purposes and set up for devnet use only.

## üéì Educational Purpose

This template is designed for developers who want to learn:

- How to build Solana programs using the Anchor framework
- How to work with PDAs for state management and program signing
- How to perform Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)
- How to create frontends that interact with Solana programs
- How to handle wallet connections and transactions on a frontend

## üìù Program Overview

The Solana program in this template demonstrates several core concepts through a simple counter application:

### Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

1. **Counter PDA**

   - Stores the counter's current value
   - Derived using the seed "counter"
   - Global state accessible to all users
   - Automatically initialized on first increment

2. **Vault PDA**
   - Holds SOL tokens from user transactions
   - Derived using:
     - Seed "vault"
     - User's public key
   - Each user gets their own vault
   - Demonstrates using PDAs for CPI signing

### Instructions

1. **Increment**

   - Increases counter value by 1
   - Performs CPI to transfer 0.001 SOL from user to vault
   - Creates counter PDA if it doesn't exist
   - Demonstrates:
     - PDA initialization
     - System program CPI for SOL transfer
     - State management

2. **Decrement**
   - Decreases counter value by 1
   - Performs CPI to transfer 0.001 SOL from vault back to user
   - Demonstrates:
     - PDA signing (vault)
     - System program CPI with PDA as signer

### Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)

The program demonstrates CPIs through SOL transfers:

- User ‚Üí Vault (increment): Basic CPI to system program
- Vault ‚Üí User (decrement): CPI with PDA signing
